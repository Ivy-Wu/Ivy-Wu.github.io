## What is MOON? :cookie:

**MO**re than **ON**e time I find myself using a new computer when I want to refer to my previous work which was done on the old one and the old computer is long gone.

**MO**re than **ON**e time I let some random (good) thoughts slip my mind because I was too lazy to jot them down earlier and then it takes forever to recall. 

_and_

**MOON**, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), has a lower surface gravity than Earth. When I feel pressured by all the troubles on Earth, I will feel less pressured on MOON due to the lack of gravity.

It is my greatest pleasure if any of my posts can help to reduce your burden or to bring you a bit of joy. Welcome again, you brave space traveller.


## What does the logo mean? :thought_balloon:

Let me start with the most straight foward equation $$1 + 1 = 2$$, which is known by many people since childhood. Even for people who are extremely scared of math, $$1 + 1 = 2$$ is probably an equation that they will feel comfortable with. This equation holds true in almost all cases, though I am tempted to argue if you hand me one spoonful of peanut butter and another spoonful of peanut butter, both will disappear and end up in my tummy.

$1 + 1 = 0$ is a slightly tricky case. I was not careful with my notation, but for anyone who is acquainted with math, a possible answer could be: yes it is true for modulo operation, in this specific case: modulo 2.
