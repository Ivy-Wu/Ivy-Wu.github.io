<h3 style="font-family:verdana"> Hello there and morning! &#127774; </h3>

<p> Welcome to your question(s) of the day! &#128521; </p>
<p> Before we start, guess what is on my mind? Hit enter to submit.</p>
<form> <input type="text" name="name" onkeyup='checkFirstAnswer()'> </form>

<script>
function checkFirstAnswer() {
  var a=document.getElementById("text_a").value;

    document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = "Nice one. My 0.2 cents to your random thoughts last night: <i> To start, I need to admit that I am probably close to illiterate when it comes to (broadly speaking) allegorical or symbolic art. Like you said, this is attributed to the way I was raised / brought up: art was generally not emphasized / particularly encouraged. I'd be very much interested in listening to you explaining to me various things but it just won't be a two-way street. And I also suspect how much it will stick.. (sorry).. <i> "
  } else {
    document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Bbbzzzzz!"
  }
  
}

<p> Second question - guess my favorite cocktail? The hint is: it is gin-based and citrusy. </p>

{% if name == "Dario" %} Nice one.
