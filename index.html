	<h2>What is Doodle Land? :cookie: </h2>
	<p>Doodle Land was originally born during covid times as a place for me to jot down random thoughts. 
		Maybe also just a way to kill some idle time.
		However, as the world return to its normal state. Doodle land was abandoned before it came to life fully.
		As I approach 30, I start to to sense this latent insecurity or confusion as who I am, what I have become and what I am going to be. 
		So I decided to resume this project, as a way to keep track of where I come from and hopefully it sheds light on where I am going.

	<p> Let me start with the most straight foward equation $1 + 1 = 2$, which is known by many people since childhood. Even for people who are extremely scared of math, it is probably an equation that they will feel comfortable with. This equation holds true in almost all cases, though I am tempted to argue if you hand me one spoonful of peanut butter and another spoonful of peanut butter, both will disappear and end up in my tummy. </p>

	<p> $1 + 1 = 0$ is a slightly tricky case. I was not careful with my notation, but for anyone who is acquainted with modulo arithmetic, a possible answer could be: yes it is true for modulo operation, in this specific case: modulo 2. Another more concrete example would be, suppose I go north 1km and then go south 1km, I end up at the starting position. </p>
	
	<p> I had a really hard time trying to come up with a reasonable math justification for $1 + 1 = 1$, however it is fairly easy to think about a real-life example. If I combine two seperated heaps of sand together, I will end up having only one heap of sand. An interesting paradox related to heaps of sand is <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox"> Sorites paradox</a>. </p>
