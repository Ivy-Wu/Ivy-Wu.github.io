## What is MOON? :cookie:

**MO**re than **ON**e time I find myself using a new computer when I want to refer to my previous work which was done on the old one and the old computer is long gone.

**MO**re than **ON**e time I let some random (good) thoughts slip my mind because I was too lazy to jot them down earlier and then it takes forever to recall. 

_and_

**MOON**, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), has a lower surface gravity than Earth. When I feel pressured by all the troubles on Earth, I will feel less pressured on MOON due to the lack of gravity.

It is my greatest pleasure if any of my posts can help to reduce your burden or to bring you a bit of joy. Welcome again, you brave space traveller.
