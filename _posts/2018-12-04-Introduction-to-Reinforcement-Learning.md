## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning


   The term _Reinforcement Learning_ has gained popularity since the day AlphaGo won four out of the five games against Lee Sedol in March 2016. A year later, AlphaGo's close relative AlphaGo Zero was able to reach AlphaGo's level in a matter of days. AlphaGo Zero starts with no external knowledge save for the rules of Go. Needless to say, the term _reinforcement learning_ became a word of magic and wonder. Rumor has it that reinforcement learning can solve virtually any complicated problem.
