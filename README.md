Let me start with the most straight foward equation /(1 + 1 = 2/), which is known by many people since childhood. Even for people who are extremely scared of math, $$1 + 1 = 2$$ is probably an equation that they will feel comfortable with. This equation holds true in almost all cases, though I am tempted to argue if you hand me one spoonful of peanut butter and another spoonful of peanut butter, both will disappear and end up in my tummy.

$1 + 1 = 0$ is a slightly tricky case. I was not careful with my notation, but for anyone who is acquainted with math, a possible answer could be: yes it is true for modulo operation, in this specific case: modulo 2.
