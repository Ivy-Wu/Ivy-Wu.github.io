	<h2>What is MOON? :cookie: </h2>
	<p><b>MO</b>re than <b>ON</b>e time I find myself using a new computer when I want to refer to my previous work which was done on the old one and the old computer is long gone. </p>

	<p><b>MO</b>re than <b>ON</b>e time I let some random (good) thoughts slip my mind because I was too lazy to jot them down earlier and then it takes forever to recall. </p>
	
	<p><i>and</i></p>
	
	<p><b>MOON</b>, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), has a lower surface gravity than Earth. When I feel pressured by all the troubles on Earth, I will feel less pressured on MOON due to the lack of gravity.<p>

	<p>It is my greatest pleasure if any of my posts can help to reduce your burden or to bring you a bit of joy. Welcome again, you brave space traveller.<p>
