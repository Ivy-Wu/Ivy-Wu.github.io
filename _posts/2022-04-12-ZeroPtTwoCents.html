<p> Nice one. My 0.2 cents to your random thoughts last night: <i> To start, I need to admit that I am probably close to illiterate when it comes to (broadly speaking) allegorical or symbolic art. Like you said, this is attributed to the way I was raised / brought up: art was generally not emphasized / particularly encouraged. I'd be very much interested in listening to you explaining to me various things but it just won't be a two-way street. And I also suspect how much it will stick.. (sorry)..</p>
